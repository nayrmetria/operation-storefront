		<h1>{{get_name}} is a global leader in cutting edge research!</h1>
		<p class="lead">{{get_name}} We are a world leading and excellent centre of scientific research, we are Gray and Dean Research Institute. Gray and Dean plays a crucial role in the scientific research of many branches of science. We have even been at the forefront of the disease deterrence program for many years. Keeping US citizens safe is at the heart of what we do.</p>

		<p>The Gray and Dean Research institute was established in late twentieth century and over the years since, has had offices in many different parts of the United States; the midwest, the bible belt, near the borders of Canada. All of this before moving to its current premises in the early 90’s where the main headquarters were finally established.</p>

		<p>The Institute employs around 15 staff plus research students and visiting scientists, and after moving to the main headquarters, we were able to increase our test subject employment rate which gives us many ways of increasing scientific research which is a wonderful thing for us all at the Gray and Dean Research institute.</p>

		<p>The Gray and Dean Research institute has been serving the United States and the surrounding areas for many years and are very proud that we are still a family owned and managed research institute. We hope that our pride reflects in our scientific service for the world at this time. The Gray and Dean Research institute is owned by two separate families but both share a passion for the research and both are friendly and kind to one another. During a trip to the headquarters, you may see some of the family, casually chatting and looking over some of the experiments they are doing to help further the global community. Our experiments are all over the scientific spectrum but, rest assured, that they are always for the good of society and they will always be for the best of intents. We, as a research community, pride ourselves on the safety of our test subjects and our scientific integrity.</p>

		<p>Our mission at The Gray and Dean Institute is to apply scientific research and knowledge, using our test subjects, to help the global community and populace to have better lives and lifestyles. Our values are that we are and always will be a world-class institute that is always where knowledge, expertise, facilities, professional excellence, and ethical standards combine to generate global and economic impacts.</p>

		<p>Every member of our staff has passion for the highest quality of performance, reliability in their results, dignity, respect and to always take pride in their science. This level of values has always been apart of our Institute, even the founders (Cain Dean and Matthew Gray) had these values which is why we must keep up with their spirit that they once held.</p>

		<p>Cain Dean was born in the Midwest, to his mother when she was only twenty years old. Cain Dean wasn’t any older when his father left them, believing Cain would tie him down and not allow him to fly as a young man. Cain’s father was eighteen when Cain was born. Cain, living with his only mother, was said to be a perfect baby, he didn’t cry or tantrum, he just stared and learned. When he could walk, his mother said he could also open doors and pick up phones. When he was seven, he was basically his mother’s answer machine, always picking up the phone and telling the other person that his mother wasn’t available. At twelve, he started up small businesses with his friends, selling baseball cards at higher prices than they were worth but it made money. As they made money, they brought more expensive products and selling them at higher prices. That Christmas, Cain and Cain’s friends bought bikes from themselves. Using this bike, Cain and his friends moved their business to another small town, only a few miles away from their home. This allowed them to run their business at two separate places and increased profits by having double the customers. In this other town, Cain noticed a brewery at the edge of town.</p>

		<p>Cycling over towards it after a long day of profit, Cain noticed that it was looking for workers. It was looking for what they called “production time engineer”, a person that needed no experience and only needed to be eighteen. Being only fourteen at the time, Cain thought that it wouldn’t go anywhere but went inside anyway, he lied about his age. He officially joined that brewery a week or so later and worked after school for some hours before cycling home. His job was basically to wait until something was blocked and pull the blockage out. He became incredibly good at this and was very nimble. He gained many friends at the brewery and was even promoted a few times. No one suspected that he was the one stealing beers away and selling them off in his home town. Cain kept doing this until he, eventually, got caught but his boss let him off, thinking he was only getting an evening beer. Cain smiled and, during that break, he and the boss became fast friends. The boss, named Phil Cassiel, liked Cain for his quick thinking and imaginative mind. This led to many other promotions and, in Cassiel’s will, leaving the brewery to Cain. Cain, quickly, gained more money and stopped selling baseball cards at higher prices. He was making real money and wasn’t even out of school yet. With this money and patience, Cain brought local shops and gained more money that way. In a few years and after he graduated from school, he controlled many different shops and heard a lot of news. </p>

		<p>Eventually, a man came to Cain, when he was seventeen. This man asked him about if he would donate to a research institute, which was researching for global good. Cain sent the man away but thought about it and, eventually, after many weeks, brought up the institute. It didn’t make a lot of profit, as it shouldn’t, but he noticed what experiments they were doing and was amazed by what they were doing for the world. Cain increased his donation and, when he became older, held a seat within the Institute’s management. This has continued until Cain’s death but not after he brought the institute and kept giving ideas for experiments and allowing for more funding. This increased until the death of Cain, whose life is immortalised by the statue outside of the institute. </p>

		<p>Matthew Gray was similar to Cain to the point where it was like they were twins. As Cain came to be the controlling figure of the brewery, Matthew had joined it as another worker, this time he was brought on as one of the people that loaded the trucks. Matthew was only fourteen but, as described by Cain, looked like he could lift a truck on those shoulders. During one lunch, Cain had come up to Matthew and, after a brief conversation, revealed that he knew Matthew was eighteen. Matthew, as told by Dean, didn’t even beg, he just told Cain that he knew he was fourteen. Dean took a liking to Matthew almost immediately, keeping him on as staff but promoting him often and giving him raises occasionally. They remained friends and were seen outside of work, sometimes enjoying movies together, eating at local cafes and, as one person says, even fishing. This lead to, when Cain became a head of the research institute, that Matthew should follow him there. After a sizeable donation from Dean, Gray became a held a similar seat within the Institute’s management. He died a little after Cain.</p>

		<p>Both of them are immortalized with a statue of them sitting on a bench together, just within the gates of the institute.</p>

		<p>The Gray and Dean Research Institute. We take pride in everything.</p>
